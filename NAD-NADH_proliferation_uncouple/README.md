# Uncoupling NAD+/NADH ratio from proliferation rate
When inhibiting mitochondria (e.g. Rotenone or Antimycin) the intracellular Aspartate concentration correlates with the NAD+/NADH ratio and both correlate with a decrease in proliferation rate.
Two hypotheses could be proposed.

### Hypothesis 1: NAD+/NADH ratio controls Aspartate, Aspartate controls proliferation
Rotenone -| mito -| NAD+/NADH -| Asp -| Proliferation

### Hypothesis 2: NAD+/NADH ratio controls both Aspartate and proliferation directly
Rotenone -| mito -| NAD+/NADH -| Proliferation

And

Rotenone -| mito -| NAD+/NADH -| Asp


### Uncoupling
It is hard to uncouple the two metabolic parameters because proliferation is typicaly rescued with pyruvate or alpha-ketobutyrate, which both restores NAD+/NADH ratio and thus also Aspartate levels.
Aspartate has to be added without affecting NAD+/NADH to uncouple the redox parameters from proliferation.
However, as Aspartate is not readily taken up by most cells.
To solve this issue 143B cells were made with stable expressing of Asp/Glu transporter SLC1A3.
These cells were then exposed to 4 different conditions: 0/50 nM Rotenone and 0/1 mM media Aspartate.
NAD+/NADH ratio was calculated from LCMS data using response ratios from U-13C internal standards.
Metabolites were extracted 24 h after addition of Rotenone/Aspartate.
Proliferation was determined using a 4 day proliferation experiment.
