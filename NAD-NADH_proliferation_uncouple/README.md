# Uncoupling NAD+/NADH ratio from proliferation rate
When inhibiting mitochondria (e.g. Rotenone or Antimycin) the intracellular Aspartate concentration correlates with the NAD+/NADH ratio and both correlate with a decrease in proliferation rate.
Two hypotheses could be proposed.

### Hypothesis 1: NAD+/NADH ratio controls Aspartate, Aspartate controls proliferation
Rotenone -| mito -| NAD+/NADH -| Asp -| Proliferation

### Hypothesis 2: NAD+/NADH ratio controls both Aspartate and proliferation directly
Rotenone -| mito -| NAD+/NADH -| Proliferation

And

Rotenone -| mito -| NAD+/NADH -| Asp

It is hard to uncouple the two metabolic parameters because proliferation is typicaly
