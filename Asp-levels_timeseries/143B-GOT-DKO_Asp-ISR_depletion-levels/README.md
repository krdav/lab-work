**Is the whole cell Asp concentration sufficiently decreased to explain ISR?**

Using 143B 2xGOT KO cells. Previously, have shown several times that ISR is mounted in less than 2 h. Therefore, test before (0 h) and after (2 h) asp levels at 0 and 2 mM Asp. Today seeded 4x 6 well plates in DMEM dia. FBS + 2 mM Asp. At 80-100 % confluency harvest metabolites in top row, washing thrice with cold saline. Then count bottom row to estimate cell volume. Harvest at time 0 h (no media change), change media to either DMEM dia. FBS + 2 mM Asp or DMEM dia. FBS +0 mM Asp. Wash thrice with media before adding 3 mL and incubating 2 h, then harvest.
Load 1 uL cell material and reconstitute in 40 uL CAA+YE. Use YE to normalize ATP and others.
