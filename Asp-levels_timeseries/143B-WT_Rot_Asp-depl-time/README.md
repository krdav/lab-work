**How fast does Asp deplete when cells are treated with Rotenone?**

Plated 3x plates of 143B WT cells in DMEM dia. FBS, no Pyr.
Start experiment by adding 60 uL 5 uM rotenone (final conc. 100 nM) to the first well. Start timer. Plates are the following with time in Rotenone (spike-in time after first spike-in):
P1: 0 (4h), 15 (3h45m), 30 (3h30m) min
P2: 1 (3 h), 2 (2h), 4 (0h) h
P3: Volume
After 4 h do metabolite extraction with no washing to preserve NAD+. Use 1 mL quenching buffer and transfer 800 uL into 50 uL neutralization buffer.
Count P3 plate to estimate cell volume. Assume that 4 h of rotenone did not modify cell size substantially.
Load 1.8 uL cell volume and reconstitute in 40 uL CAA+YE to quantify both Asp and NAD+/NADH ratio.
