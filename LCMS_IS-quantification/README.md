# Folder for LCMS based quantification
Here, I am processing calibration curves generated by a dilution series with isotopically labelled internal standards.
For simple amino acid quantification see folder `AA_quant_standard-curve`. This is based on a mix of all amino acids, dried and reconstituted in solvent containing a fixed concentration of U-13C, U-15N labelled amino acids (Cambridge Isotope, item number: MSK-CAA-1).
For amino acid, nucleoside and nucleobase quantification see folder `Spirulina_IS`. This is for quantifying all amino acids and several pools of nucleoside/nucleobases and some other central metabolites. The internal standards are U-13C and are isolated from U-13C spirulina powder (Cambridge Isotope, item number: CLM-8400-PK).

The calibration curves are generated by curve fitting picking the best fit from linear, 2. degree exponential or power function. For more detail look into the `plot_cal-curve.ipynb` notebooks.

After fitting the curves they are plotted and manually inspected. Finally, each curve function is saved (using Python pickle) in a data file that can be imported in other data processing scripts for later use.
