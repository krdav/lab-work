# Development of methods for amino acid and nucleoside quantification
This contains method development for quantification of amino acids and nucleobases (and nucleosides) from cell material.
LCMS, U-13C labelled standards and calibration curves are used for quantification.

The `stability_enzymatic_whole-cell` folder contains:
* Test of NEB Nucleoside Digestion Mix
* Repeatability of quantification from cell material
* Saturation of compounds as a function of input cell material
* Acid stability of amino acid, nucleobase and nucleoside pools

The `temp_opti` folder contains:
* Released quantities of nucleobases and nucleosides from cell material at different temperatures
* Stability of a pool of nucleosides at different temperatures

The `time_opti_80C` folder contains:
* Released quantities of nucleobases, nucleosides and amino acids from cell material at increasing time
