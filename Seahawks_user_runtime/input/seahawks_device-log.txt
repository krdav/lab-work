  Checklist:
    1.  Is the calibration slide loaded into the Calibration Tray?
    2.  Is the calibration slide loaded with IncuCyte Color Calibration Solution?
    3.  Is the correct Calibration Solution being used?  That is, are its emission wavelengths matched to the IncuCyte filters?
    4.  Is the correct Filter-Module/Lamphouse combination installed in the IncuCyte?
    5.  The calibration slide might be defective.  Did you try a different slide?
    6.  The phase lamphouse could be malfunctioning.  Did you run an Optics Test?
